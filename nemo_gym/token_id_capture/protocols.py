"""Define interfaces for captured training tokens.

Gym owns the record shape and capture protocols.
A training framework may implement the transport.
The sink may run in a Gym model server.
It may instead run in a framework inference worker.
Engine-side placement keeps token arrays off Gym's HTTP response.
Consumers read through ``TokenSource.freeze``.
They identify the frozen state with ``snapshot_id``.
This module avoids FastAPI, Ray, Torch, and aiohttp imports.

The serving path awaits ``TokenSink.put`` before returning the model response.
When ``put`` returns, the record must be durable and visible to every worker's lineage resolver.
The harness can then send a continuation to any worker without racing publication of the previous call.
A transport that returns before cross-client visibility can produce intermittent unresolved samples under load.

A sink may additionally implement ``begin_call(rollout_id, model_call_id)``.
It is an optional extension and deliberately not part of the ``TokenSink`` protocol.
``begin_call`` durably records a pre-dispatch intent.
An intent with no matching entry at freeze must mask the rollout.
That closes the window where the final call's entry is lost without a trace.
``begin_call`` runs before generation, so the caller may fail the model call at zero compute cost.

``nemo_gym.token_id_capture.conformance`` checks an external implementation against these contracts.
